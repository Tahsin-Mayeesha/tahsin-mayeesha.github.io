        <p>Hi! I am currently working as a researcher in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsuhci/home">NSU HCI DIAL(Design and Inclusion) Lab</a>
          on a Google funded project to research on education related barriers and challenges of South Asian women in computing. Concurrently I'm also managing 
          3 Bengali NLP projects in the domain of Bengali Question Answering/Generation research as a senior Research Assistant. I have worked as a predoctoral
          fellow in <a href="https://www.fatimafellowship.com/"> Fatima Fellowship</a> on a NLP project with mentor <a href="https://benjamin-mlr.github.io/">Benjamin Muller</a>
          on investigating cultural biases such as formality in multilingual generative models.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my undergrad at <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu/">North South University (NSU)</a> 
          in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, I got into research 
          when I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rXMM2MwAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr Nova Ahmed</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=L9S6rlUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Rashedur M Rahman</a>. 
          I've graduated from Computer Science and Engineering major (North South University) in Fall 2020. My thesis project was on building deep learning models for question answering systems 
          in Bengali where I trained multilingual BERT models on synthetic data. My research experience has so far been around NLP, AI Ethics/Policy and HCI.

            My research is at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with 
            the goal of developing data-driven (e.g. images, videos) algorithms that can accurately and efficiently understand, model, and recreate the 
            visual world around us. I have made contributions towards 
            solving notable problems in computer vision by developing methods that tackle heavy class imbalance conditions, reduce need for intensive manual labeling efforts 
            and better separates small and ambiguous regions. These contributions 
            have been demonstrated on a variety of computer vision tasks that require <strong>visual input</strong> 
            spanning object recognition, image synthesis and semantic segmentation etc.. 🧠 👀

              <strong>ICML</strong> and <strong>MICCAI</strong>. For my Ph.D research, I recieved the Concordia University Doctoral Graduate Fellowship as well as the 
              International Tuition Award of Excellence. In my MASc, I recieved the two-year

              Multilingual generative language models (LMs) are increasingly fluent in a large variety of languages. Trained on the concatenation 
              of corpora in multiple languages, they enable powerful transfer from high-resource languages to low-resource ones. However, it is still unknown 
              what cultural biases are induced in the predictions of these models. In this work, we focus on one language property highly influenced by 
              culture: formality. We analyze the formality distributions of XGLM and BLOOM's predictions, two popular generative multilingual language models, in 5 languages. 
              We classify 1,200 generations per language as formal, informal, or incohesive and measure the impact of the prompt formality on the predictions. 
              Overall, we observe a diversity of behaviors across the models and languages. For instance, XGLM generates informal text in Arabic and Bengali when conditioned 
              with informal prompts, much more than BLOOM. In addition, even though both models are highly biased toward the formal style when prompted neutrally, we find that 
              the models generate a significant amount of informal predictions even when prompted with formal text.We release with this work 6,000 annotated samples, 
              paving the way for future work on the formality of generative multilingual LMs.

              University courses and curricula on the ethics of computing are increasing, yet there are few studies about how CS programs should
              account for the diverse ways ethical dilemmas and approaches to ethics are situated in cultural, philosophical and governance systems,
              religions and languages. This paper seeks to prompt conversations about CS education that accounts for ethics in the Global Souths. We
              draw on the experiences and insights of 46 university educators and 9 practitioners, in Latin America, South Asia, Africa, the Middle east
              and Australian First Nations. Our modest study sought to inform revisions of the ACM’s international curricular guidelines for the Society,
              Ethics and Professionalism knowledge area in undergraduate CS programs. Participants’ responses in surveys and interviews illustrate
              difficulties in translating regional and local practices, explicit or implicit values and the changing impacts of technologies, into a singular
              vocabulary about ethics, such as formal ethical Codes of professional conduct. They illustrate opportunities for university teaching, and
              allied learning activities, to link more closely to students’ priorities, actions and experiences in the Global Souths and enrich students’
              education in the Global North.

              Recent advances in the field of natural language processing has improved state-of-the-art performances on many tasks including question answering for 
              languages like English. Bengali language is ranked seventh and is spoken by about 300 million people all over the world. But due to lack of data and active 
              research on QA similar progress has not been achieved for Bengali. Unlike English, there is no benchmark large scale QA dataset collected for Bengali, no pretrained 
              language model that can be modified for Bengali question answering and no human baseline score for QA has been established either. In this work we use state-of-the-art 
              transformer models to train QA system on a synthetic reading comprehension dataset translated from one of the most popular benchmark datasets in English called SQuAD 2.0.
              We collect a smaller human annotated QA dataset from Bengali Wikipedia with popular topics from Bangladeshi culture for evaluating our models.
              Finally, we compare our models with human children to set up a benchmark score using survey experiments.

              Data driven activism attempts to collect,analyze and visualize data to foster social change. However, during media
              censorship it is often impossible to collect such data. Here we demonstrate that data from personal stories can also help us to
              gain insights about protests and activism which can work as a voice for the activists. </a>.</p>

              <p>The dataset consists of 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images generated using <a href="https://github.com/hasibzunair/synthetic-covid-cxr-gen">algorithm</a>. 
                Dataset is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/hasibzunair/synthetic-covid-cxr-dataset/releases/tag/v0.1">here</a>. The primary use of this dataset
                is to be used as additional data for training machine learning models.
